Title: "Modelling the effect of Longitudinal Markers on Left-Truncated Time-to-Event Outcomes in Twin Studies"

Authors: Muli, A., Rodr√≠guez-Girondo, M., and Houwing-Duistermaat, J.
Code was written by Muli, A.


The code was written in R with the following software versions:
R version 4.2.1 (2022-06-23)
Platform: x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64 (64-bit)


This folder contains the following files:

1. A collection of documented R scripts that contain all required functions to perform the four methods presented in the manuscript. 

    - `LOCF.R`
    A R script with the function to apply the Last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach
    
    -  `ORC.R`
    A R script with the function to apply the Ordinary Regression Calibration (ORC) approach

    - `RRC.R`
    A R script with the function required to apply the Risk set Regression Calibration (RRC) approach
    
    - `Pseudo joint model analysis.R`
    A R script with the function required to apply the two-stage joint modeling (JM) approach

2. An example simulated dataset following the required format to run performed the four methods introduced in 1. 

   The dataset is contains the following variables:
    
   - `SurvTime` : survival time
   - `status`: censoring indicator
   - `A0`: age at entry in the study
   - `cluster`: the name of the variable in the data containing cluster IDs
   - `id`: the name of the variable in the data containing individual IDs
   - `Cov`: the longitudinal outcome measurements
   - `CovTime`: age at covariate measurement
